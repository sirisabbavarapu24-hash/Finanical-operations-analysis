🔍 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end financial analytics solution using real-world retail transaction data (541,909 records). The objective is to analyze business performance by integrating revenue forecasting, customer churn prediction, and profitability analysis using statistical and machine learning techniques.

The project demonstrates how data-driven financial insights can support strategic planning, customer retention, and revenue optimization.

🎯 Objectives

Forecast future revenue trends using time-series modeling

Identify customers at risk of churn using machine learning

Evaluate overall and segment-wise profitability

Generate actionable business insights for decision-making

📂 Dataset

The project utilizes the Online Retail Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

541,909 transactions

8 features including InvoiceDate, Quantity, UnitPrice, CustomerID

Revenue calculated as: Quantity × UnitPrice

Cost assumed as 70% of revenue for profitability estimation

🧹 Data Preprocessing

Removed missing CustomerID values

Eliminated negative quantities (returns)

Converted InvoiceDate to datetime format

Engineered new features: Revenue, Cost, Profit

Aggregated monthly revenue for time-series analysis

📈 Revenue Forecasting

Aggregated monthly revenue from transaction data

Tested stationarity using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test

Implemented ARIMA (1,1,1) time-series model

Forecasted revenue for the next 6 months

Visualized historical and predicted revenue trends

Business Value:

Helps organizations in budgeting, financial planning, and demand estimation.

🤖 Customer Churn Prediction

Defined churn as customers inactive for more than 90 days

Engineered customer-level features (Revenue, Frequency, Quantity)

Implemented:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Evaluated models using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision & Recall

Business Value:

Early identification of at-risk customers enables retention strategies and revenue protection.

💰 Profitability Analysis

Calculated total revenue: 8.9M+

Estimated total profit: 2.67M+

Computed profit margin ≈ 30%

Identified top 20% customers contributing majority of profit

Analyzed monthly profit trends

Business Value:

Helps optimize pricing strategies and focus on high-value customer segments.
